# myElevatorNov26
my first simulation for the elevator, solve the elevator allocation problem
## execution file
simulationNov26.py
## optimization objective
minimize the average elevator time for the people from each floor
## Methodology
Initially allocate a floor to an elevator, then compute the average time for each elevator. Then, add a floor to the elevator
with the least time.
